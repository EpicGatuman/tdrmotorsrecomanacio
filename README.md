To run the code, place the .csv files from the ml-latest-small dataset inside a folder with that exact name, located in the same directory as the Python script. The code references the data from that path.

This is part of a research project aimed at investigating how small changes to a parameter in a recommendation system can drastically alter its output. The idea is to show that what users see—and therefore consume—can be artificially manipulated, highlighting the potential for large companies to exploit this influence.

The Python code provided explores this behavior through controlled experiments.
The full project report is available in Catalan in the attached PDF.
